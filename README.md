## 1. Introduction

### What is NO2?
NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) is a gas primarily produced from the combustion of fossil fuels, such as in motor vehicles and power plants. It is one of the major components of air pollution and has detrimental effects on human health, particularly the respiratory system. This project analyzes the concentration levels of NO2 in various locations to understand its distribution patterns and its impact on air quality.

### The Importance of Monitoring NO2
Monitoring NO2 levels is crucial as it contributes to the formation of secondary pollutants, such as ground-level ozone, which is harmful to human health. By analyzing NO2 data, we can identify areas with high pollution levels and propose policies or solutions to reduce its impact on public health.

## 2. Data Description
The **GroundTruth-NO2** dataset contains various environmental factors that affect NO2 concentration levels, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sensor location. The dataset is time-series based, collected from multiple sensors across different locations.

### Dataset Features:
- `datetime`: Date and time of measurement
- `latitude`: Latitude of the sensor
- `longitude`: Longitude of the sensor
- `temperature`: Temperature in Celsius
- `humidity`: Humidity percentage
- `wind_speed`: Wind speed in meters per second
- `NO2_level`: Groundtruth NO2 concentration (target variable)

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this step, visualizations and statistical analysis are performed to understand the dataset's characteristics, such as the distribution of NO2 levels, relationships between features, and the presence of missing values or outliers. The geographical distribution of NO2 data is also explored.

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing
Before training machine learning models, data cleaning is performed, which includes handling missing values and normalizing continuous features. The data is then split into training and testing sets for model development.

### 3.3 Model Development
Several machine learning models are tested, including random forest, and XGBoost, to predict NO2 concentration levels based on available features.
